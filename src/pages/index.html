### Washington, DC: America’s Home Field

The U.S. National Team has played more matches in DC than any other city across the globe. DC is the only city in the United States that hosted the 1994 FIFA Men’s World Cup, 1996 Olympic soccer games and the 1999 and 2003 FIFA Women’s World Cup.

### Rich History of the Game

D.C. United, the most decorated club in MLS history, multiple NCAA Men’s and Women’s Soccer National Champions and the U.S. Soccer’s Centennial Celebration match reside here. Soccer legends like Beckham, Bruce, Cruyff, Mia, Pele, Pope, Rooney and Zlatan have either had career highlights here or called DC home. 

### The Future of the Sport

The DC community has more than 300,000 active youth players, 60 clubs and dozens of non-profits engaging kids in soccer activity across all of our communities year-round.

The halls of Congress may house representatives from the United States, but DC is also home to representatives from around the globe. With the second-largest concentration of embassies in the world, our nation’s capital is also one of the world’s capitals of culture.

### America’s Melting Pot

Washington, DC is one of the most diverse cities in the country. Home to citizens of more than 170 nationalities and ethnic groups, DC has become a microcosm of America’s melting pot. And, due in large part to this mix of cultures, DC was named America’s “Most Exciting Food City in America” by Bloomberg in 2019.
