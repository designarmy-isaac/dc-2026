#### History of the Game

DC has hosted some of soccer’s biggest moments, including the 1994 World Cup, David Beckham’s MLS debut, and more U.S. National Team games than any other city. Soccer legends like Pele, Mia Hamm, Wayne Rooney, Zlatan Ibrahimović, and Johan Cruyff have either had career highlights here or called DC home.

#### DC - America’s Home Field

DC is America’s Capital of soccer. Home to the most trophied franchise in the MLS, multiple NCAA Men’s Soccer National Champions, and some of the greatest matches of the past century, DC is united by its love of the game and prepared to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

#### International Fandom - On and Off the Field

Soccer is among the most popular youth and adult sports played year-round in DC. Ranked third in the country for adult participation, soccer remains a part of Washingtonians’ lives well after youth sports, both on and off the field. From the bars of H Street to Embassy Row, if soccer’s on, DC is watching. For three out of the last four years, DC has ranked first in viewership for the Premier League and is a top ten market for Liga MX.'

The New York Times named DC the #1 place to visit in 2020 for its “already-rich culture and dining scene, offering a vast menu of fresh sights and tastes,” with restaurants from culinary superstars like Jose Andres and Danny Meyer, and nationally-renowned local chefs.  

#### Not Just a Monument to Soccer

DC’s large network of free museums, art galleries, and public spaces are world-renowned for both their beauty and their free access for all who visit the city. 

#### Room to Celebrate

With over 130 hotels and 31,348+ hotel rooms within the city alone, and 694+ hotels and 111,075+ hotel rooms within the greater metro area, DC is well-equipped to serve as a home base for World Cup fans.'

#### Ready-Built

With major airports, railways, and highways to get fans into the Nation’s Capital and a robust mass transit system to move fans within the city, DC’s transportation options are unrivaled in capacity and navigability.

#### A True Host City

Each year, the District hosts over 20 million visitors, with more than 2 million overseas visitors from China, the UK, Germany, Australia, France, India, South Korea, Brazil, Italy, and Japan. A world-class city with world-class infrastructure, the District has a track record of hosting large scale events with ease — from presidential inaugurations and championship parades to yearly fireworks displays and cherry blossom festivals that draw hundreds of thousands of people and fans to DC yearly.

#### A Place to Play

Some say the District was built to host democracy, but the modern DC is also equipped to host sporting events at scale. With 13 acres of practice fields and state-of-the-art training facilities, the second-largest stadium in the NFL, and four professional sports arenas within a five-mile radius of its downtown, our Nation’s Capital is uniquely qualified to host the World Cup.'
tab4-content: '
The halls of Congress may house representatives from the United States, but DC is also home to representatives from around the globe. With the second-largest concentration of embassies in the world, our Nation’s Capital is also one of the world’s capitals of culture.

DC is also one of the most diverse cities in the country. Home to citizens of more than 170 nationalities and ethnic groups, the District has become a microcosm of America’s melting pot. And, due in large part to this mix of cultures, DC was named America’s “Most Exciting Food City in America” by Bloomberg in 2019.'
